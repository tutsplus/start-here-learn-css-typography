			<p>Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.</p>

			<p>He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.

			<p>As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.</p>
